# ELEC0135ML2
The code for ELEC0135 coursework
This coursework is investigating using EDRS model for image super-resolusion. Two differnent datasets are used.
Please place the dataset in  correct path, as code is using relevent path

Folder A: full code for training, validation and testing of task 1
Folder A: full code for training, validation and testing of task 2
Required environments:
    -pytorch
    -pillow
    -matplotlib
    -tqdm
    -torch torchvision
    -pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
    -Also, a yaml file in each task folder contains a copy of the environment
The code could run using main.py directly or could run the code in each task separately. No change need to be made
if the dataset is in correct path, or the dataset path needs to be changed.
